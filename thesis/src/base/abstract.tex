\project\ offers a simple and easy to use tool for increasing the productivity of kernel network module developers. It automates the process of testing these modules, drastically reducing the development time.

The solution presented in this paper consists of an application which creates and starts all the nodes and the links between them for a given topology. This permits the user to easily run different tests on the nodes he spawned with \project\ without the need to configure manually several Virtual Machines or systems.
